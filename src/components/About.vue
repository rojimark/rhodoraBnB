<h5>BACKGROUND</h5>	
<p>
	Rhodora Bed and Breakfast is owned by a family who acquired the property.  Through the years, the family had often used the property for private gatherings and functions with and for friends. However, they eventually thought the place was too good not to share. So began the concept of opening a commercial apartel.
	The owner wanted to develop their property that would reflect their support to environment conservation with a concept that would harmoniously mix both quaint and modern fixtures. They came up with a lay-out of air-conditioned rooms fashioned from up-cycled cargo containers. It has been designed to withstand natural calamities such as typhoons and earthquakes.
